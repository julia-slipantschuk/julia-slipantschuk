## Research interests

My research is in chaotic dynamical systems and understanding their long-term behaviour using functional analytical techniques. I am interested in the interplay between Ergodic Theory and Spectral Theory, in particular in Ruelle resonances of hyperbolic dynamical systems. I also have a strong interest in applications, developing algorithms to approximate dynamical quantities of interest such as invariant measures, mixing rates, Lyapunov exponents, dimensions of hyperbolic attractors.

## Professional history

In 2014, I received my PhD from Queen Mary University of London under the joint
supervision of Wolfram Just and Oscar F. Bandtlow (see [my thesis](/data/thesis.pdf)).

From 2014 to 2018 I worked as a Research Engineer at London-based sports data analytics start-up Stratagem, developing machine learning based trading strategies for sports markets.

From 2018 to 2021 I was a PostDoctoral Research Assistant at the [School of Mathematical Sciences,
Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/).

In 2021, I joined the [Mathematics Institute of the University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/) as a Research Fellow.
