I am currently a Research Associate (Akademische Rätin) at the 
[Department of Mathematics of the University of Bayreuth](https://www.dsd.uni-bayreuth.de/en/team/index.html).

You can contact me at **firstname.lastname@uni-bayreuth.de**

My departmental address is:

**Department of Mathematics\
University of Bayreuth\
Bayreuth 95444**

## Research interests

My research is in chaotic dynamical systems and understanding their long-term behaviour using functional analytical techniques. I am interested in the interplay between Ergodic Theory and Spectral Theory, in particular in Ruelle resonances of hyperbolic dynamical systems. I also have a strong interest in applications, developing algorithms to approximate dynamical quantities of interest such as invariant measures, mixing rates, Lyapunov exponents, dimensions of hyperbolic attractors.

## Professional history

In 2010, I obtained my Masters Degree in Interdisciplinary Sciences from ETH Zurich.

In 2014, I received my PhD from Queen Mary University of London under the joint
supervision of Wolfram Just and Oscar F. Bandtlow (see [my thesis](/data/thesis.pdf)).

From 2014 to 2018 I worked as a Research Engineer at London-based sports data analytics start-up Stratagem, developing machine learning based trading strategies for sports markets.

From 2018 to 2021 I was a PostDoctoral Research Assistant at the [School of Mathematical Sciences,
Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/).

From 2021 to 2024, I was a Research Fellow at the [Mathematics Institute of the University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/).

In 2024, I joined the [Department of Mathematics of the University of Bayreuth](https://www.math.uni-bayreuth.de/en/) as a Research Associate (Akademische Rätin).
